Logarithms are used to find the powers of numbers. 

They are also used in the Richter scale, the PH scale, and the Decibel scale. 

A logarithm is written like this: 

log a(b) = c

Where a is the base, b is the product, and c is the power in an exponential expression. 

the above is converted to an exponential expression like this:
food
a^c = b

The log laws. 

log law 1:
log A + log B = log AB

log law 2:
log A - log B = log A/B

log law 3: 
log A^n = n log A

log law 4: 
- log A = log 1/A


The change of base formula: 
log b C = (log a C) / (log a B)

log b C = (log a C) / (log a B)
