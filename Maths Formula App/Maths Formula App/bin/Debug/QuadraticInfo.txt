This is the quadratic formula. It will solve any quadratic equation that you put in it for x. 

Furthermore, you can use the terms in the square root to quickly find out if there are two possible values for x, one, or none. 

If the terms inside the square root are less than 0, there are now answers, and no x intercepts on a Cartesian plane. If it equals 0, there is one answer for x and one x intercept for the Cartesian plane. If it is more than 0, there two possible answers and two x intercepts on the Cartesian plane.
