 Sin Cos and Tan can be used to find the angles of a right angle triangle.                        SohCahToa stands for Sine; opposite over hypotinuse, Cosine; adjasent over hypotinuse, Tangent; opposite over adjasent.                        In a triangle the opposite side to the angle being found is the farthest one from it, and the adjacent one is the closest that is not the hypotinuse.     

if the angle is negative, the triangle doesn't exist.
